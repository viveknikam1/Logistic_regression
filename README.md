# Logistic_regression
Applying logistic regression to classify social network data-set.
Logistic regression to classify Age and salary based data to wheather customer is going to purchase perticular item or not. 
About Dataset: Dataset is having five columns['User ID', 'Gender', 'Age', 'EstimatedSalary', 'Purchased']. From which two are used as an independent variables ie 'Age' and 'EstimatedSalary'. Here "Purchased" is dependent variable, need to classify based on independent variables. I have used Logistic regression here and accuracy score I got here is about 85%.
